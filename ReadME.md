## OOP in Java

> Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and Objects

## Main Concepts in OOP

- Object
- class
- Inheritance(extends)
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation


- Override
- Implements

## Object 

> Any entity that has a state and behavior is known as an object.
e.g Car, Chair.

> An object can be defined as instance of a class.

## class

> A class can be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual class.

## Inheritance

>

## Implements
> This relation may hold between a class and an interface.

> if C Implements I then C contains code for the behavior specified in interface I 

          Class C Implements I {
            // bodies for methods specified in I
          }

## Inheritance(extends)

> The extends relation may hold between 
- Two interfaces
- Two classes

> If B extends A then B Inherits all the methods of A.

## Abstraction

> Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

## Encapsulation
> Encapsulation focus on Private Data. Encapsulation allows the programmer to hide and restrict access to data. 

> To achieve encapsulation:
  - Declare the variables with the private access modifier
  - Create public getters and setters that allow indirect access to those variables

## Caveats About Java interfaces
- interfaces cannot have constructors.
- interfaces cannot have static method contracts without also providing correspoding method bodies.

## Caveats to Java classes
- constructors are not inherited.
- Static methods are inherited.

## What does overriding do?
> To override a method means methods that are already being implemented in a class being extended can be overwritten and provided new method bodies.

> Java and other object-Oriented languages decide which method body to use for any call to an instance based on the object type of the receiver.
- This behavior for calling methods is known as ___Polymorphism___.

## When is a method overloaded?
> A method is overloaded when two or more methods have the same name, in which case the methods must differ in the number and/or types of their formal parameters(Which the compiler uses to differiate the methods).
